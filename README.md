# project-awesome-books
"Awesome Books" s a book collection website that displays a list of books and allows you to add and remove book from that list. It is a complete single page application with working navigation. By building this project, I learned how to manage data using Javascript, create an interactive SPA and use a medium-fidelity wireframe.
